Abstract :

The Navigational forecasting-Anticipating Traffic Routes project aims to address the 
complexities of urban mobility through the use of advanced machine learning algorithms. By 
leveraging algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, and Random 
Forest, the project seeks to enhance the efficiency of transportation systems by providing accurate 
and timely predictions for optimal traffic routes.Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a powerful 
algorithm known for its ability to find optimal hyperplanes, which allows for effective 
classification in high-dimensional spaces. This makes SVM particularly well-suited for the task of 
traffic route prediction, where the input data can be complex and multidimensional. Decision 
Trees, on the other hand, offer interpretability and visualization for complex decision-making 
processes. They provide insights into the factors influencing route decisions, making them 
valuable for understanding traffic patterns.The project also integrates Random Forest, an 
ensemble learning algorithm that further enhances predictive accuracy. Random Forest works by 
combining the strengths of multiple Decision Trees, leading to more robust predictions. These 
features include personalized recommendations, real-time updates, and environmental impact 
analysis. By providing users with personalized recommendations, the project aims to help them 
make more informed decisions about their travel routes. Real-time updates ensure that users are 
always aware of the latest traffic conditions, while environmental impact analysis helps users 
choose routes that are more environmentally friendly.Overall, the Traffic Route Prediction project 
aims to revolutionize urban mobility by offering users a comprehensive and sustainable 
transportation solution. By leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms and user-centric 
features, the project seeks to enhance the efficiency of transportation systems and improve the 
overall urban mobility experience for users
